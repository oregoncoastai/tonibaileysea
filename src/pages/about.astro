	<h2>Artistic Journey</h2>
	<div class="two-column">
		<div>
			<p>
				Toni's artistic journey began over twenty years ago when she first moved to the Oregon Coast. Captivated by 
				the dramatic meeting of land and sea, she found herself compelled to capture these moments on canvas. What 
				started as weekend painting excursions soon evolved into a lifelong passion and profession.
			</p>
			<p>
				After studying fine arts at Pacific Northwest College of Art in Portland, Toni honed her distinctive style 
				that blends traditional techniques with contemporary expression. Her work is characterized by vibrant colors, 
				dynamic compositions, and an intimate understanding of coastal light and atmosphere.

	<h2>Inspiration & Process</h2>
	<p>
		Drawing inspiration from the ever-changing moods of the Pacific Ocean, the misty forests of the Coast Range, 
		and the abundant wildlife that calls this region home, Toni's work celebrates the natural beauty and 
		environmental significance of the Oregon Coast.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm fascinated by the intersection of water, light, and land," Toni explains. "There's a moment when the 
		setting sun breaks through storm clouds over the ocean, or when morning mist clings to coastal forests â€“ 
		these fleeting moments contain so much emotion and energy. My goal is to capture not just what these scenes 
		look like, but how they feel."
	</p>
	<p>
		Toni works primarily in oils and acrylics, often beginning with plein air studies that she later develops 
		into larger studio pieces. Her process involves multiple layers of paint to achieve the luminous quality 
		that has become her signature style.

				In 2018, Toni opened her gallery, "Toni Bailey by the Sea," in a charming historic building overlooking 
				Newport's picturesque harbor. The gallery serves as both a showcase for her work and a creative studio 
				space where visitors can often find her painting.
			</p>
			<p>
				The gallery has quickly become a destination for art collectors and coastal visitors alike, offering a 
				curated collection of original paintings, limited edition prints, and art cards. Toni also hosts seasonal 
				exhibitions, workshops, and community art events throughout the year.
